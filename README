MeBook is a ebook reader for Fremantle and Harmattan. At the moment it only supports the epub file format.

Currently a MeeGo/Harmattan version of MeBook is in active development.

To build for Harmattan you need Qt SDK with Harmattan target. (http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/)

TODO:
- epub resources not loading sometimes
- better toc handling
- page view
  * moving from section to another
- annotation and bookmark dialogs
- fix database operations and remove library class
