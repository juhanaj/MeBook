<em>Lawrence Lessig</em></p>
<p>Lawrence Lessig, “the most important thinker on intellectual
property in the Internet era” (The New Yorker), masterfully argues
that never before in human history has the power to control
creative progress been so concentrated in the hands of the powerful
few, the so-called Big Media. Never before have the cultural
powers- that-be been able to exert such control over what we can
and can’t do with the culture around us. Our society defends free
markets and free speech; why then does it permit such top-down
control? To lose our long tradition of free culture, Lawrence
Lessig shows us, is to lose our freedom to create, our freedom to
build, and, ultimately, our freedom to imagine.</p>

Twain</em></p>
<p>Roughing It follows the travels of young Mark Twain through the
Wild West during the years 1861–1867. After a brief stint as a
Confederate cavalry militiaman, he joined his brother Orion
Clemens, who had been appointed Secretary of the Nevada Territory,
on a stagecoach journey west. Twain consulted his brother's diary
to refresh his memory and borrowed heavily from his active
imagination for many stories in the novel.</p>
<p>Roughing It illustrates many of Twain's early adventures,
including a visit to Salt Lake City, gold and silver prospecting,
real-estate speculation, and his beginnings as a writer.</p>
<p>In this memoir, readers can see examples of Twain's rough-hewn
humor, which would become a staple of his writing in his later
books, such as Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, The Adventures of
Tom Sawyer, and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.</p>

Enclosing the Commons of the Mind</a>, <em>James Boyle</em></p>
<p>In this enlightening book James Boyle describes what he calls
the range wars of the information age—today’s heated battles over
intellectual property. Boyle argues that just as every informed
citizen needs to know at least something about the environment or
civil rights, every citizen should also understand intellectual
property law. Why? Because intellectual property rights mark out
the ground rules of the information society, and today’s policies
are unbalanced, unsupported by evidence, and often detrimental to
cultural access, free speech, digital creativity, and scientific
innovation.<br />
Boyle identifies as a major problem the widespread failure to
understand the importance of the public domain—the realm of
material that everyone is free to use and share without permission
or fee. The public domain is as vital to innovation and culture as
the realm of material protected by intellectual property rights, he
asserts, and he calls for a movement akin to the environmental
movement to preserve it. With a clear analysis of issues ranging
from Jefferson’s philosophy of innovation to musical sampling,
synthetic biology and Internet file sharing, this timely book
brings a positive new perspective to important cultural and legal
debates. If we continue to enclose the “commons of the mind,” Boyle
argues, we will all be the poorer.</p>

David Thoreau</em></p>
<p>Walden (also known as Life in the Woods) by Henry David Thoreau
is one of the best-known non-fiction books written by an American.
Published in 1854, it details Thoreau's life for two years and two
months in second-growth forest around the shores of Walden Pond,
not far from his friends and family in Concord, Massachusetts.
Walden was written so that the stay appears to be a year, with
expressed seasonal divisions. Thoreau called it an experiment in
simple living.</p>
<p>Walden is neither a novel nor a true autobiography, but a social
critique of the Western World, with each chapter heralding some
aspect of humanity that needed to be either renounced or praised.
The work is part personal declaration of independence, social
experiment, voyage of spiritual discovery, and manual for self
reliance. (from Wikipedia)</p>
