Shelley</em></p>
<p>Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, generally known as
Frankenstein, is a novel written by the British author Mary
Shelley. The title of the novel refers to a scientist, Victor
Frankenstein, who learns how to create life and creates a being in
the likeness of man, but larger than average and more powerful. In
popular culture, people have tended to refer to the Creature as
"Frankenstein", despite this being the name of the scientist.
Frankenstein is a novel infused with some elements of the Gothic
novel and the Romantic movement. It was also a warning against the
"over-reaching" of modern man and the Industrial Revolution,
alluded to in the novel's subtitle, The Modern Prometheus. The
story has had an influence across literature and popular culture
and spawned a complete genre of horror stories and films. It is
arguably considered the first fully realized science fiction
novel.</p>

<em>H. G. Wells</em></p>
<p>The War of the Worlds (1898), by H. G. Wells, is an early
science fiction novel which describes an invasion of England by
aliens from Mars. It is one of the earliest and best-known
depictions of an alien invasion of Earth, and has influenced many
others, as well as spawning several films, radio dramas, comic book
adaptations, and a television series based on the story. The 1938
radio broadcast caused public outcry against the episode, as many
listeners believed that an actual Martian invasion was in progress,
a notable example of mass hysteria.</p>

Wonderland</a>, <em>Lewis Carroll</em></p>
<p>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) is a novel written by
English author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known under the
pseudonym Lewis Carroll. It tells the story of a girl named Alice
who falls down a rabbit-hole into a fantasy world populated by
peculiar and anthropomorphic creatures.<br />
The tale is filled with allusions to Dodgson's friends (and
enemies), and to the lessons that British schoolchildren were
expected to memorize. The tale plays with logic in ways that have
made the story of lasting popularity with adults as well as
children. It is considered to be one of the most characteristic
examples of the genre of literary nonsense, and its narrative
course and structure has been enormously influential, mainly in the
fantasy genre.</p>

Cristo</a>, <em>Alexandre Dumas</em></p>
<p>The Count of Monte Cristo (French: Le Comte de Monte-Cristo) is
an adventure novel by Alexandre Dumas, père. It is often
considered, along with The Three Musketeers, as Dumas' most popular
work. It is also among the highest selling books of all time. The
writing of the work was completed in 1844. Like many of his novels,
it is expanded from the plot outlines suggested by his
collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.<br />
The story takes place in France, Italy, islands in the
Mediterranean and the Levant during the historical events of
1815–1838 (from just before the Hundred Days through the reign of
Louis-Philippe of France). The historical setting is a fundamental
element of the book. It is primarily concerned with themes of hope,
justice, vengeance, mercy, forgiveness and death, and is told in
the style of an adventure story.</p>

Nikolayevich Tolstoy</em></p>
<p>War and Peace is a novel by Leo Tolstoy, first published from
1865 to 1869 in Russkii Vestnik, which tells the story of Russian
society during the Napoleonic Era. It is usually described as one
of Tolstoy's two major masterpieces (the other being Anna Karenina)
as well as one of the world's greatest novels.<br />
War and Peace offered a new kind of fiction, with a great many
characters caught up in a plot that covered nothing less than the
grand subjects indicated by the title, combined with the equally
large topics of youth, marriage, age, and death. Though it is often
called a novel today, it broke so many conventions of the form that
it was not considered a novel in its time. Indeed, Tolstoy himself
considered Anna Karenina (1878) to be his first attempt at a novel
in the European sense.</p>
